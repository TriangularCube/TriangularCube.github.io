title: TriangularCube's Working Definitions of Philosophy, Ideology, and other Theories
date: '2022-03-31'

There is a huge amount of either misinformation or just bad information out there, and of course there are simply
disagreements about how to label any given phenomenon. This document attempts to capture what I believe are a good
working definition of these terms, as I understand them; I will attempt to update them as new information becomes
relevant, and I will endeavour to capture historical and colloquial uses outside the usages documented here.

The first idea I want to touch upon is central to so much, and yet is very ill defined, partly because its effects are
not easily felt or interpreted.

#### Ideology

Slavoj Zezek has an excellent long form film about ideology called [The Pervert's Guide to Ideology](https://archive.org/details/2013ThePervertsGuideToIdeology/2013+-+The+Pervert's+Guide+to+Ideology.mp4) (you'll need to select the
12th video manually). It gets into a lot of the intricacies of its effects and why it's so hard to pin down, but it's
long and meandering and honestly not a particularly engaging film. The best working definition I've come to use is one
given by [Philosophy Tube (Timestamped Here)](https://youtu.be/VlLgvSduugI?t=39):

_Ideologies determine what facts are important, and what actions are acceptable_

Having defined a starting point, I think I should make clear that I see people tend to confuse ideologies with other,
non-ideological theories. Specifically, I would like to highlight that Capitalism _is not_ an ideology, it is a theory
of economic organization. There also exist political-economic theories which functionally contain aspects of both, such
as Communism (of the Lenin variety).

I'd also like to point out here that Economic Theories' primary purpose is to define a system to address the problem of
limited resources and unlimited desires. This is true for all economies, as they are a means of understanding production
and consumption, though not always strictly separated from other facets of society.

Well alright, let's talk about...

#### Capitalism

Capitalism is surprisingly both easy and hard to define. It is, as said above, a theory of Economic Organization. It
views production as requiring a few different factors of input, and is primarily concerned with Capital, which is
generally agreed _among classical economists[^1]_ as the most important. Broadly speaking, Capitalism has the following
characteristics:

Capitalism assumes:
- Humans are rational decision makers.
- Humans are driven by lots of motivations, but nothing is stronger than self-interest.

These two assumptions are understood to not be perfectly accurate, but is approximate enough to predict behaviour.

Capitalism prescribes:
- Because the strongest drive is self-interest, economies should be organized such that work produced should _primarily_
 reward the producer.
- To facilitate rewarding the producer, the factors of production should be **Privately Owned**
- Prices for exchange should be set by a market, based on forces of supply and demand
- There are three[^2] primary factors of production (in classical economics):
    - Labour: work directly produced by a human.
    - Land: not only real estate, but also bounties of the land, i.e. materials
    - Capital: goods which participate in production, but are not immediately consumed[^3]

Capitalism considers Capital to be the most important factor because it argues that without Capital, productive activity
is limited (specifically to what 1 person can command). Therefore, to "scale up" production so to speak, capital is
first required to buy Land (materials) and pay for Labour - in other words, [Economic Activity is limited by available
Capital](http://gameofrent.com/content/progress-and-poverty-review#i-wages-and-capital#:~:text=Because%20wages%20are%20generally%20paid%20in%20money)
[^4] [^5] <sup>[<span style="color:#89bcbd">citation needed</span>]</sup>.

By the above definition, labour is not paid for by the resulting products, but by the Capital invested in the process.
In order to make a return, the amount of wages paid to labour is _always_ going to be lower than what the products are
exchanged for; this is called profit, and is considered the return on the investment by Capital.

#### Marxism

Despite what a lot of people on the internet thinks, Marxism is not an economic theory. Marx wrote a whole lot about
Capital and Capitalism, and he even proposed an alternative, what he called Communism, but _Marxism_ doesn't really
denote a coherent theory of anything in particular.

[^1]: Classical (and Neo-Classical) economics are a particular flavour of Capitalistic theory. There are, of course,
many others, but in general Classical is what people associate with the word Capitalism, and is the originator of what
could be thought of as a distinct Economic Theory (having been developed by he who is generally considered the father of
modern Economics, Adam Smith)

[^2]: There are also schools of thought which considers entrepreneurship a fourth primary factor of production
([short primer here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-inputs-are-considered-be-factors-production.asp#:~:text=Land%2C%20labor%2C%20capital%20and%20entrepreneurship%20are%20the%20four%20categories%20of,the%20primary%20factors%20of%20production.))

[^3]: The significant exception to this is depreciation (which includes wear and tear, etc.)

[^4]: Okay, I'm borrowing here since I can't find an actual citation that succinctly summarizes this, so here's me
pointing to an article about Georgism in which George critiques Classical Economics' views on Capital.
