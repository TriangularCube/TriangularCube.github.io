title: TriangularCube's Working Definitions of Philosophy, Ideology, and other Theories

There is a huge amount of either misinformation or just bad information out there, and of course there are simply disagreements about how to label any given phenomenon. This document attempts to capture what I believe are a good working definition of these terms; I will attempt to update them as new information becomes relevant, and I will endeavour to capture historical and colloquial uses outside the usages documented here.

The first idea I want to touch upon is central to so much, and yet is very ill defined, partly because its effects are not easily felt or interpreted.

#### Ideology

Slavoj Zezek has an excellent long form film about ideology called [The Pervert's Guide to Ideology](https://archive.org/details/2013ThePervertsGuideToIdeology/2013+-+The+Pervert's+Guide+to+Ideology.mp4) (you'll need to select the 12th video manually). It gets into a lot of the intricacies of its effects and why it's so hard to pin down, but it's long and meandering and honestly not a particularly engaging film. The best working definition I've come to use is one given by [Philosophy Tube (Timestamped Here)](https://youtu.be/VlLgvSduugI?t=39):

_Ideologies determine what facts are important, and what actions are acceptable_

<hr />

Having defined a starting point, I think I should make clear that I see people tend to confuse ideologies with other, non-ideological theories. Specifically, I would like to highlight that Capitalism _is not_ an ideology, it is a theory of economic organization. There also exist political-economic theories which functionally contain aspects of both, such as Communism (of the Lenin variety).

Well, speaking of Capitalism...

#### Capitalism

_NOTE: I'd like to point out here that Economic Theories' primary purpose is to define a system to address the problem of limited resources and unlimited desires._

Capitalism is surprisingly both easy and hard to define. It is, as said above, a theory of Economic Organization. It is primary concerned with Capital, which is generally agreed _among academics_ as one of the three inputs of **production**, which is an important activity in Capitalism. Broadly speaking, Capitalism has the following characteristics:

Capitalism assumes:
- Humans are rational decision makers.
- Humans are driven by lots of motivations, but nothing is stronger than self-interest.

The above two assumptions are understood to not be perfectly accurate, but is approximate enough to predict behaviour.
