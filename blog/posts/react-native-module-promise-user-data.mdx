React Native's Native Modules are great, but their documentation is a little...lacking.
Let's talk about the `UserInfo` field when we reject a promise in a Native Module.

According to the docs (for both Android and iOS), RN Native Module promises can be rejected
with various combinations of the following parameters:

```java
String code, String message, WritableMap userInfo, Throwable throwable
```

That's great! Except we never quite get where to _find_ `userInfo`. After some poking
around, I found that you can access `userInfo` from the `error` object caught
on a promise rejection.

```js{8}
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native'
const {SomeModule} = NativeModules

...
try {
    await SomeModule.doSomething()
} catch (error) {
    error.userInfo
}
```

Simple, so it's very strange this is just not documented anywhere.
