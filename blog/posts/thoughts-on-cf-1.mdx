This past week was CloudFlare's _Platform Week_ in which some extremely exciting
announcements were made, among them that Wrangler 2 is now Generally Available.
There were a bunch of features I've been waiting for available in Wrangler 2, such as
Stages and ESBuild with no (or less) configuration, and I finally got a chance to
give it a shot this weekend trying to build something with Durable Objects, something
else I haven't really worked with before, and the process was...not great. It wasn't
terrible, but the whole ecosystem is a hodgepodge of slightly outdated information
and a lot of getting started guides without a cohesive structure, even the API docs
are not terribly communicative.
