This past week was CloudFlare's _Platform Week_ in which some extremely exciting
announcements were made, among them that Wrangler 2 is now Generally Available.
There were a bunch of features I've been waiting for available in Wrangler 2, such as
Stages and ESBuild with no (or less) configuration, and I finally got a chance to
give it a shot this weekend trying to build something with Durable Objects, something
else I haven't really worked with before, and the process was...not great. It wasn't
terrible, but the documentation are a hodgepodge of slightly outdated information
and a lot of getting started guides without a cohesive structure, even the API docs
are not terribly communicative.

I understand how this could be the case, CloudFlare is moving extremely fast to
provide cloud architecture for full stack applications, and docs are mostly aimed
at getting newcomers up and running without a whole lot of clarity. Heck, even AWS
docs, as long as they've been around, are kind of terrible at providing the type
of docs that explains what it is each parameter is doing while we work at building
an application.

So, let's go on a journey to build something interesting with Durable Objects with
Wrangler 2.

## Setting the Scene

Durable Objects are a really cool tech that provides a guaranteed singular instance
of an object
